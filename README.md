Ground Control Point Marker Detection

What Are Ground Control Points?

Ground Control Points, or GCPs, are marked points on the ground that have a known geographic location. In aerial surveying, a drone can be used to autonomously collect photos of the survey area. If used, GCPs must be visible in these aerial photos. The photos are then processed in the cloud using drone mapping software. A common solution for collecting and processing drone data, used by many mapping professionals, is DroneDeploy. Services like DroneDeploy create 2D orthomosaics, 3D models, digital elevation models (DEMs), and 3D point clouds from drone images. For aerial survey applications GCPs, are typically required as they can enhance the positioning and accuracy of the mapping outputs.

When and Why Are GCPs Important?

When used correctly, ground control points greatly improve the global accuracy of your drone map. That is to say, they help ensure that the latitude and longitude of any point on your map corresponds accurately with actual GPS coordinates. This is important in situations where precision mapping and true global accuracy are needed. As we mentioned above, surveying companies generally use GCPs, because a high level of global accuracy is important in most of the work that they do. Virtual design and construction is another sector that often requires this level of precision drone mapping.
